# solid-js and axum-rs template

This repo is for creating [solid-js](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) apps served using [axum-rs](https://github.com/solidjs/solid). *You will still have to manually run `yarn install`.

The `build.rs` file will remake the solid app anytime you modify files within `frontend/`. Axum is set up to serve the default solid app.
